# Holmes

A conversational platform to help users decrease the risk associated with their business

## Inspiration
Business-relevant data is complex and its analysis requires expertise that is rarely available to small business owners.

## What it does
Our app leverages content-providing APIs such by IBM Weather Company and Thomson Reuters to generate relevant, local and accessible advice. Insights are generated using IBM Watson machine learning API and Thomson Reuters PermID API or text understanding.

## How We built it
Energizers, coffee and resolve. (Disclaimer: some sleep was involved)

## Accomplishments that We're proud of
Slick GUI and a bouquet of different APIs working in RESTful harmony.

## What's next for Holmes
More content sources, new analysis methods and smarter advice.
